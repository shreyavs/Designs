### Walmart Redesign
I worked on re-designing the Walmart digital experience as part of a two-person team for my HCI course at Carnegie Mellon University. To create improvedÂ user interfaces, we employed HCI tools and techniques like Contextual Inquiry, Rapid Prototyping, Heuristic Analysis, and Think-Aloud User Testing. The final interactive prototype included 3 new feature recommendations and 5 design improvements for existing features to optimize the user journey.
